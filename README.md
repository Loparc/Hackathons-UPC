Code: code.rhai
Role on this project: Co-creator / Team Leader
Project made for HachUPC 2022 where we had to design an algorythm that could compete against other teams. The main objective was to controll or _colored cells_ in order to paint the map.
The main difficulty relied on the fact that the algorythm had to be done in 'rhai' language.
