Project:  https://devpost.com/software/splatoon-capchase-challenge <br>
Code: code.rhai <br>
Role on this project: Co-creator / Team Leader <br> <br>
Project made for HachUPC 2022 where we had to design an algorythm that could compete against other teams. <br>
The main objective was to controll or _colored cells_ in order to paint the map. <br>
The main difficulty relied on the fact that the algorythm had to be done in 'rhai' language.
